## Development

This project was created using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), and [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/).

To get started, run `npm install` to grab the dependencies.
React commands:

- `npm start` will start the react development server
- `npm test` to start jest tests
- `npm run build` to produce production builds

AWS Amplify commands:

- `amplify push` will push any changes made to the server and update local content accordingly
- `amplify publish` to run a production build and upload hosted content to AWS S3
